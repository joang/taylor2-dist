# taylor version 2

taylor is an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver generator that

1. generates source code automatically,
2. has high level of reusability, and
3. is thread-safety.

Moreover, taylor also

4. allows flexibility arithmetic definition,
5. provides high accuracy numerical solutions,
6. incorporates jet transport, and
7. computes directional, first order, and high-order variational equations.

We recommend to take a look to the manual for further details.
