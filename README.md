# taylor version 2

taylor generates an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver that

1. writes source and header codes automatically,
2. has a high level of reusability, and
3. is thread-safe.

Moreover, taylor also

4. allows flexible arithmetic definition,
5. provides highly-accurate numerical solutions,
6. incorporates jet transport, and
7. computes directional, first-order, and high-order variational equations.

We recommend reviewing the manual for further details.
